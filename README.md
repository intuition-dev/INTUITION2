# About MetaBake

MetaBake.org is a development productivity suite. It should allow you to deliver 10 times faster then legacy development stacks/methodologies. We have found that - with MetaBake.org; - the work of 6 developers over 6 months can be done by 3 developers in 3 weeks. We expect you to achieve the same productivity gains.


#### MetaBake.org productivity is based on three modules:

- nBake, a static site generation tool that runs locally
- B-M-SPA, curated technologies and techniques that help you build dynamic apps and mobile apps faster
- Meta, a bespoke cloud-based build and admin app infrastructure that helps deliver functionality to your clients more quickly

We benchmark against _LAMP_, _RAILS_, _MEAN_ and such For example, LAMP is the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so technology gets 10 times better, which *forces* everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C/.js is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive team.

So far, somehow, server-side rendered LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WordPress having some 30% of the World Wide Web. It is time to start displacing that.

You can reinvest the time saved by using MetaBake into a more interactive user experience (UX). Better UX is proven to lead into higher user engagement and better user retention.

# About Meta

This section is about _Meta_, your bespoke cloud-based admin and build infrastructure; used on your web app. You need to know _nBake_ first, but once you learn it, instead of using _nBake_ CLI, you use _Meta_. (if you are not comfortable with nBake, go learn that first. Here we just wrap API arround it.) In _nBake_ you mounted your web app in the cloud, and with _Meta_, you admin|build is also in the cloud; both the web app and build are! That is what makes it Meta.

 _Meta_ is meant to be bespoke/customized.
