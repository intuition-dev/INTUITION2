<!-- story -->
Our Goal: Deliver 10 X faster than today's software development. Ex: 5 dev in 6 months to be done 2 devs in 3 weeks.  For example LAMP, the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so tech gets 10 times better *FORCING* everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive team.

So far, somehow, SSR LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WP having some 30% of WWW - time to start displacing that.

The extra power of nbake can be used to 'tell the story better', by being more interactive in your UX. Experience shows that better UX translates to more user engaged and higher user retention.

We assume that everyone is web literate, for example:
' Design and Build Websites ' by Jon Duckett

We also assume that you will learn Pug.

Some of the META benefits, in addition to nbake:
- Deliver an order of magnitude developer productivity improvement.
- There is no local development environment, client less development added to your server-less hosting.
- The source code stays in the cloud, not laptop that admins or developers take home.
- Cool factor: you can develop from Chrome Book, IOS Tablet (w/ Apple Bluetooth keyboard) or Android tablet.
- Team player, you set up docker for your entire team.
