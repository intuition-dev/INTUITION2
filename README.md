Here we have

* Information on how to install and run in the cloud in the docs folder:

Some of the META benefits, in addition to nbake:
- Deliver an order of magnitude developer productivity improvement.
- There is no local development environment, client less development added to your server-less hosting.
- The source code stays in the cloud, not laptop that admins or developers take home.
- Cool factor: you can develop from Chrome Book, IOS Tablet (w/ Apple Bluetooth keyboard) or Android tablet.
- Team player, you set up docker for your entire team.
