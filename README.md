Benfits of admin:
- The source code stays in the cloud, not laptop that admins or developers take home.
- Cool factor: you can develop from ChromBook, IOS Tablet (w/ Apple Bluetooth keyboard) or Andorid tablet.
- There is no local development enivorment, client less development added to your servless hosting.
- Team player, you set up docker for your entire team.
