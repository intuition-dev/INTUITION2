### METAbake&trade; is a development productivity suite. It should allow you to deliver 10 times faster than on a LAMP stack. We have found that - with METAbake&trade; - the work of 5 developers over 3 months can be done by 2 developers in 3 weeks. We expect you to achieve the same productivity gains.


This is project 3 of 3 Meta&reg;

Here is the home of the advanced Meta project. It is an API wrapper for nbake. It is written in Express, Pug and Typescript, meant to be customized and extended. It is hosted in Docker in the cloud.

<!-- story -->
Our Goal: Deliver 10 X faster software development.
We leverage curated list of tech and technique. For example one of about 10 of them is: we reposition Pug as 4GL declarative language.

For comparison LAMP, the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so tech gets 10 times better *FORCING* everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive software development team.

So far, somehow, SSR LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WP having some 30% of WWW - time to start displacing that. But there are staticlly generated CMS approaches trying to get at them.

The extra power of nbake can be used to 'tell the story better', by being more interactive in your UX. Experience shows that better UX translates to more user engaged and higher user retention.

As a starting point, we assume that everyone is web literate, for example:
' Design and Build Websites ' by Jon Duckett
We also assume that you will learn Pug.

Meta&reg; Logo- is a monkey using a box to reach something: You should use a build server.

Project contains:
* Example Admin/Build/API pages that you can use as a starter for your bespoke meta - in the exMeta folder

* Information on how to install and run in the cloud in the docs folder:
- http://github.com/metabake/META/blob/master/PERSPECTIVE/docs/README.md


Some of the Meta benefits, in addition to nbake:
- Deliver an order of magnitude developer productivity improvement.
- There is no local development environment, client less development added to your server-less hosting.
- The source code stays in the cloud, not laptop that admins or developers take home.
- Cool factor: you can develop from Chrome Book, IOS Tablet (w/ Apple Bluetooth keyboard) or Android tablet.
- Team player, you set up docker for your entire team.
