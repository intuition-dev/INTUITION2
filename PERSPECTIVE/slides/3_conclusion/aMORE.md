## 10 practices of the confident tech META bespoke admin|build|methodology&reg; manager:

Conclusion
* low code
PHP creator hated to code. Now they have 40% share of WWW.


by:
* Decide to face the user or face the server. Avoid SSR. Focus is productivity in itself. Ex, turn towards the UX, face the customer.
* Have a productivity goal: ex 1 screen per day
* Extreme cloud, use spreadsheet, know lifetime costs
* Avoid 3 GL / Procedural / Algol =  eschew js
* Instead of 'line count', 'review' based on UX
* Avoid resume based development
* No full stack: Convergence of dev and designer
* Rapid prototype / Prototype -> UX. So evaluate need for 'PDF' prototypes, like PhotoShop. You should count on your RAD. Instead look at User Stories plus Intercept/Observe.
* Intercept users early
* Mount a drive. In the cloud. With Docker. Running Express build server.
* Web IDE!
* LAMP: No L, A, M. Yes to P
* Remote friendly.
* Developers that love to code can be harmful.
* Nitro clod brew coffee.
* Avoid FTP. Mount (and cache). Reduce Git.


Staff you don't need going forward
2 IOS developers
2 Android developers
2 Full stack/back end developers
1 Photoshop guy/hal

Staff you do need:
- Designer that codes, or a Front end developers that designers
- Build/release engineer(can be out sourced)

One last thing:
We used to sell an accounting software. By running it, a company could fire some book keepers. The value.
Meta = by using this approach - you can manage costs.


<!-- story -->
Our Goal: Deliver 10 X faster than today's software development. Ex: 5 dev in 6 months to be done 2 devs in 3 weeks.  For example LAMP, the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so tech gets 10 times better *FORCING* everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive team.

So far, somehow, SSR LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WP having some 30% of WWW - time to start displacing that.

The extra power of nbake can be used to 'tell the story better', by being more interactive in your UX. Experience shows that better UX translates to more user engaged and higher user retention.

We assume that everyone is web literate, for example:
' Design and Build Websites ' by Jon Duckett

We also assume that you will learn Pug.
