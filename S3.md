Using a CDN/FTP is easier, but some people like AWS/S3.

1. Using CloudBerry or S3Browser, create a bucket - and upload you app.

2. Configure the access policy so that the bucket can be accessed.


		{
		"Version":"2012-10-17",
		"Statement":[{
			"Sid":"PublicReadGetObject",
				"Effect":"Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
				"Action":["s3:GetObject"],
				"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::example.com/*"
				]
			}
		]
		}


1. Now goofYs to map to your 'S3', where the webapp is:

		//edit your credentials [other2] part is very optional, if you have other S3 or other buckets:
		cat ~/.aws/credentials
		[default]
		aws_access_key_id = KEY
		aws_secret_access_key = SECRET
		[other2]
		aws_access_key_id = KEY2
		aws_secret_access_key = SECRET2

		//also optional, install 'aws cli', we don't use it, but some people like it
		pip install awscli

		//and you may what to check the speed of the Docker host provider
		pip install speedtest-cli
		speedtest-cli

		//remove the project file created above
		rm -rf ~/workspace/s3
		mkdir ~/workspace/s3

		// mount your S3 bucket there, use your BUCKET-NAME
		/root/goofys --profile default -o allow_other --use-content-type BUCKET-NAME /var/www/html/workspace/s3

		// check to see your S3 webapp files
		ls ~/workspace/s3

		//come back later and setup http://github.com/kahing/catfs

Go back to browser and refresh the browser. Joy? We have S3 inside the container. The group IDE can edit S3 project. Later you can customize the IDE.
