Using a CDN/FTP is easier, but some people like AWS/S3.

1. Using CloudBerry or S3Browser, create a bucket - and upload you app files.

2. Configure the access policy so that the bucket can be accessed.


		{
		"Version":"2012-10-17",
		"Statement": [{
			"Sid":"PublicReadGetObject",
				"Effect":"Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
				"Action":["s3:GetObject"],
				"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET/*"
				]
			}]
		}

3. See if you can access it form a browser.

4. Map to the production server from CodeAnywhere, to make sure your AWS access key and secret are working. (the keys are under 'Security Credentials' AWS menu)

3. Now to setup the build server, setup goofYs to map to your 'S3':

		cd ~
		wget http://bit.ly/goofys-latest
		mv goofys-latest goofys
		chmod +x goofys

		//edit your credentials, [other2] part is very optional:
		mkdir ~/.aws
		nano ~/.aws/credentials
			[default]
			aws_access_key_id = KEY
			aws_secret_access_key = SECRET
			[other2]
			aws_access_key_id = KEY2
			aws_secret_access_key = SECRET2


		// mount your S3 bucket there, use your BUCKET-NAME
		./goofys --profile default -o allow_other --use-content-type BUCKET-NAME ~/admin/prod

		// check to see your S3 webapp files
		ls XXX


 We have S3 inside the container. The group IDE can edit S3 project. Later you can customize the IDE.
