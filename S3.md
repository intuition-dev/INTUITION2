Using a CDN/FTP is easier, but some people like AWS/S3.

0. Install WebDrive 2018 (needed in Step 4).

1. Go to https://aws.amazon.com/s3 and "Get started with Amazon S3". Create a new AWS account (Basic tier) if needed and sign in to the console. On the dashboard, find the S3 service and navigate to it.

2. Create a bucket (e.g. name 'lab1.my.domain') in US East N. Virginia (Advanced users: choose your preferred region). On the Properties tab, select 'Static website hosting' and 'Use this bucket to host a website'. Copy the Endpoint URL for later use. Once created, on the Detail Permissions tab, configure the access policy so that the bucket can be accessed.
	```
	{
		"Version":"2012-10-17",
		"Statement": [{
			"Sid":"PublicReadGetObject",
				"Effect":"Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
				"Action":["s3:GetObject"],
				"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET/*"
				]
			}]
	}
	```

3. In AWS Menu 'Account - My Security Credentials', create a new Access Key (advanced users: use an IAM credential instead). Click 'Show Access Key'. 

4. In WebDrive 2018, create a new Amazon S3 connection (Advanced users: change the URL for any custom region you have selected for your bucket, e.g. s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com, see regions for S3 at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html). Copy/paste Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from step 3. Select the bucket (e.g. 'lab1.my.domain'), continue, name the site (e.g. 'My S3 Lab1 Drive') and assign a letter, then click 'Finish'.

5. From your file manager, in the new drive, create a file index.html with a basic `<html><body>My site here</body></html>` as content.
Acccess the file in the browser at the endpoint URL from step 2, e.g.  http://lab1.my.domain.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com 

6. Map to the production server from CodeAnywhere, to make sure your AWS access key and secret are working. (the keys are under 'Security Credentials' AWS menu)

7. Now to setup the build server, setup goofYs to map to your 'S3':

		cd ~
		wget http://bit.ly/goofys-latest
		mv goofys-latest goofys
		chmod +x goofys

		//just in case you need it
		ln -s /var/log ~

		//edit your credentials, [other2] part is very optional:
		mkdir ~/.aws
		nano ~/.aws/credentials
			[default]
			aws_access_key_id = KEY
			aws_secret_access_key = SECRET
			[other2]
			aws_access_key_id = KEY2
			aws_secret_access_key = SECRET2


		// mount your S3 bucket there, use your BUCKET-NAME
		~/goofys --profile default -o allow_other --use-content-type BUCKET-NAME ~/admin/prod

		// check to see your S3 webapp files
		ls XXX

8. With S3, in CodeAnywhere, map to the build server to use the production with 'watch' feature.

 We have S3 inside the container. The group IDE can edit S3 project. Later you can customize the IDE.
