## First steps to Meta

- Create a CodeAnywhere account

Use a WebIDE to be a team player and remote friendly. (*_MetaBake_ pillar 9). Using CodeAnywhere ("CA"), connect to SSH / S3. To enable Pug, in the bottom right corner, next to indentation mark, click on the "editor mode" and select "Pug" from the list.

You can choose a commercial vendor to setup and co-host your Meta admin/build environment, or just use the open-source version. They are listed on Resources page (click on the left).
With this section, we now eschew local development and instead develop in the cloud.

Continue here with open source, all linked from the left.
Note that before you start with this Meta/Vista section of Metabake, you should be comfortable with mbake/foundations section.
