# What is Meta?

http://youtube.com/watch?v=WyCdSFTUIvM

Meta is a new version of CASE (Computer aided software engineering). Meta is 'automatic programing'. Now... you may say, there is no way for my application/product, that I can build a program that write the program.

You can.

Think hard, and for more than just a few minutes.

( Worst cast, engage a consulting gig to define this, from a Meta knowledgeable company.)
