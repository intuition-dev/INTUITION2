# Meta

It is a 'mini-Jenkins', specialized for nBake and rapid development in the cloud.

When using _Meta_ in the cloud, code is kept on the build server. Developers do not need to maintain and sync copies of code or content.

When using a Web IDE(ex: CodeAnywhere, https://codeanywhere.com ) on that code, developers do not need to setup and manage their own development environment - a browser is all they need. Cool factor: you can develop from Chrome Book, IOS Tablet (w/ Apple Bluetooth keyboard) or Android tablet.

These features should allow you to achieve additional productivity gains for your developer team.
