[Chat: metaBake.org ](http://chat.metaBake.org)


MetaBake.org is a development productivity suite. It should allow you to deliver 10 times faster than on a LAMP stack. We have found that - with metaBake.org; - the work of 5 developers over 3 months can be done by 2 developers in 3 weeks. We expect you to achieve the same productivity gains.


MetaBake.org productivity is based on three pillars:
- _nbake_, a static site generation tool that runs locally
- _B-M-SPA_, curated technologies and techniques that help you build dynamic apps and mobile apps faster
- _meta_, a cloud-based build and admin app infrastructure that helps deliver functionality to your clients more quickly.
