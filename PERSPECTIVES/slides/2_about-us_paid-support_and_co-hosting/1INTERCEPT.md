Projects start with Intercept and Observe - Parts of Lean UX research.

One member of your dev team, ex: lead front end developer|designer should physically observe a target persona. What people say and what they do is not the same.

There are services that can help schedule observation of your target, ex: http://ethn.io/pricing or https://www.userinterviews.com/
