### METAbake&trade; is a development productivity suite. It should allow you to deliver 10 times faster than on a LAMP stack. We have found that - with METAbake&trade; - the work of 5 developers over 3 months can be done by 2 developers in 3 weeks. We expect you to achieve the same productivity gains.

I heard you like 3 tier:
1. CDN/FTP/S3 HTTP Host
2. A host for Docker build server in the cloud
3. Fire store


## How to get started:

- Manager will create the above 3 accounts.

- Manager will facilitate user|feature stories.
- Manager will monitor developer productivity, ex: # of pages per day/week.
- Manager will putting people in positions to succeed. For example, a full stack developer does not have sufficient CSS experience = can't do front end dev.
- Web design agency willing to use Pug, FireBase
- Meta methodology includes Intercept/Observe. At least show how much you care before you show how much you know.
