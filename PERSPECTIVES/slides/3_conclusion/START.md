## Meta&reg; with Docker admin, give you 10X better web app development productivity. For example, when we went from 2nd GL to 3GL. It includes an admin/build server, selected tech stack and a recommended software development management methodology. So work of 5 devs in 6 months can be done by 2 devs in 3 weeks.

I heard you like 3 tier:
1. CDN/FTP/S3 HTTP Host
2. A host for Docker build server in the cloud
3. Fire store


## How to get started:

- Manager will create the above 3 accounts.

- Manager will facilitate user|feature stories.
- Manager will monitor developer productivity, ex: # of pages per day/week.
- Manager will putting people in positions to succeed. For example, a full stack developer does not have sufficient CSS experience = can't do front end dev.
- Web design agency willing to use Pug, FireBase
- Meta methodology includes Intercept/Observe. At least show how much you care before you show how much you know.
