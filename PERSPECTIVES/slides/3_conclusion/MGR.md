We used to sell accounting software: By running it, a company could fire some book keepers. The value.

Meta = by using this approach - you can manage costs.

A software development manager Excel example on head count/staffing/resources:
- Server-less + API = no Backend team is gone, ~40% to 60% staffing AND resource cut
- 4GL Declarative programing = ~ 2X to 10X productivity increase
- Build server/build engineer = force multiplier. 2 to 3 FTE savings
- Polyglot staff = increased retention, 10% to 20% productivity due to domain knowledge
- Intercept/Observer = 2X savings - due to building the right thing sooner.
- 50% smaller engineering budget = more money to marketing/lead gen
- WebIDE = 15% to 25% improved on IDE stability and remote support.
- Focus on Front End = being in the zone more, less context switching.
- Measure a before vs after, or A/B test
By Meta, we mean be aware.

There is a glut of developers. 90% are not productive. We will be left with good ones. A bit like sales, 10% of Sale people sell 90%. If you cut sales staff by 90% - you lose 10% of sales and 90% of cost.
And there are 3 kinds: Worth their salary. Not worth their salary. And a 3rd kind: that make others have low productivity, worth paying them to work at a competitor.

Staff you should reduce/outsource going forward:
- IOS developers
- Android developers
- Full stack|back end developers
- Photoshop guy/gal
"We decided to go in a different direction, we can use consulting in a transition"

Staff (you do need):
- Designer that codes, that is ideal, may cost more. Or a Front end developers that knows design. CSS interview. Polyglot FE (Front end frameworks)
- Build/release engineer(can be out sourced)
- Content Producer/Editor/Writer

Meta is disruptive - in the full meaning of the word.
Disruptive that 3gl is different from 4GL. Things that worked in 3GL don't apply. Like manually managing memory in Java for people coming to C. Feel like it needs to be there - it does not. Ex: Flux is a 3gl technique. In Meta, inside the tag you do you api calls.


Sin list:
* Avoid 3 GL / Procedural / Algol =  eschew js
* Avoid Full stack developers: They don't know CSS.
* Avoid resume based development
* No full stack: Convergence of dev and designer
* Rapid prototype / Prototype -> UX. So evaluate need for 'PDF' prototypes, like PhotoShop. You should count on your RAD. Instead look at User Stories plus Intercept/Observe.
* Developers that love to code can be harmful.
* Avoid FTP. Mount (and cache). Reduce Git - you don't put your DB in git, just back up.
* Less git. More content DB back up.
* JSX. Takes declarative lang into procedural.
* No LAM(+P)
* Front end team separate from native mobile team.
* There are developers detached from customer or from business value


Question: you are conducting an interview a candidate, they know CSS Frameworks, passed an oral exam (ex: When to use Absolute). Please estimate time to write back end and middleware REST API service + User auth(join/password reset, etc) for 6 pages/screens. With  ORM, cache, secured edge distributed servers, CORS. Assume 5 api calls per page/screen. Estimate how long that would take you?
- Meta developer answer: 0 time.

A developer boasts: we can make this faster!
- Mgr: What is the time Bob our customer has now, vs what will they see after?
Avoid these tests that if a button is clicked 1000 times, the loop is 10ms faster. Some developers are just not self aware and can't be helped - until their next job.
Tie it to the customer - this is why you involve devs in Intercept/Observe.

Also, I am big fan of quarterly bonus. ~20% of comp should be quarterly based on goals. S.M.A.R.T. or better OKR.

Alibaba: 2 people that do work of 4 and get paid for 3.

Project management tip on delays:
- Start w/ how many days per page/screen.
- Let say answer is 2 weeks to do all '8'.
- On due day - I need an extra week.
:-). That is sunk cost.
- What do you do as SD manager?
- Hint: Mythical Man Month.
