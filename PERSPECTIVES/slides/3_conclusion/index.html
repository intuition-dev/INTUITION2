The value.</p>
<p>Meta = by using this approach - you can manage costs.</p>
<p>A software development manager Excel example on head count/staffing/resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server-less + API = ~40% to 60% staffing AND resource cut</li>
<li>4GL Declarative programing = ~ 2X to 10X productivity increase</li>
<li>Build server/build engineer = force multiplier. 2 to 3 FTE savings</li>
<li>Polyglot staff = increased retention, 10% to 20% productivity due to domain knowledge</li>
<li>Intercept/Observer = 2X savings - due to building the right thing sooner.</li>
<li>50% smaller engineering budget = more money to marketing/lead gen</li>
<li>WebIDE = 15% to 25% improved on IDE stability and remote support.</li>
<li>Focus on Front End = being in the zone more, less context switching.</li>
<li>Measure a before vs after, or A/B test
By Meta, we mean be aware.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a glut of developers. 90% are not productive. We will be left with good ones. A bit like sales, 10% of Sale people sell 90%. If you cut sales staff by 90% - you lose 10% of sales and 90% of cost.
And there are 3 kinds: Worth their salary. Not worth their salary. And a 3rd kind: that make others have low productivity, worth paying them to work at a competitor.</p>
<p>Staff you should reduce/outsource going forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>IOS developers</li>
<li>Android developers</li>
<li>Full stack|back end developers</li>
<li>Photoshop guy/gal
&quot;We decided to go in a different direction, we can use consulting in a transition&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff (you do need):</p>
<ul>
<li>Designer that codes, that is ideal, may cost more. Or a Front end developers that knows design. CSS interview. Polyglot FE (Front end frameworks)</li>
<li>Build/release engineer(can be out sourced)</li>
<li>Content Producer/Editor/Writer</li>
</ul>
<p>Meta is disruptive - in the full meaning of the word.
Disruptive that 3gl is different from 4GL. Things that worked in 3GL don&#39;t apply. Like manually managing memory in Java for people coming to C. Feel like it needs to be there - it does not. Ex: Flux is a 3gl technique. In Meta, inside the tag you do you api calls.</p>
<p>Sin list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid 3 GL / Procedural / Algol =  eschew js</li>
<li>Avoid Full stack developers: They don&#39;t know CSS.</li>
<li>Avoid resume based development</li>
<li>No full stack: Convergence of dev and designer</li>
<li>Rapid prototype / Prototype -&gt; UX. So evaluate need for &#39;PDF&#39; prototypes, like PhotoShop. You should count on your RAD. Instead look at User Stories plus Intercept/Observe.</li>
<li>Developers that love to code can be harmful.</li>
<li>Avoid FTP. Mount (and cache). Reduce Git - you don&#39;t put your DB in git, just back up.</li>
<li>Less git. More content DB back up.</li>
<li>JSX. Takes declarative lang into procedural.</li>
<li>No LAM(+P)</li>
<li>Front end team separate from native mobile team.</li>
<li>There are developers detached from customer or from business value</li>
</ul>
<p>Question: you are conducting an interview a candidate, they know CSS Frameworks, passed an oral exam (ex: When to use Absolute). Please estimate time to write back end and middleware REST API service + User auth(join/password reset, etc) for 6 pages/screens. With  ORM, cache, secured edge distributed servers, CORS. Assume 5 api calls per page/screen. Estimate how long that would take you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta developer answer: 0 time.</li>
</ul>
<p>A developer boasts: we can make this faster!</p>
<ul>
<li>Mgr: What is the time Bob our customer has now, vs what will they see after?
Avoid these tests that if a button is clicked 1000 times, the loop is 10ms faster. Some developers are just not self aware and can&#39;t be helped - until their next job.
Tie it to the customer - this is why you involve devs in Intercept/Observe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I am big fan of quarterly bonus. ~20% of comp should be quarterly based on goals. S.M.A.R.T. or better OKR.</p>
<p>Alibaba: 2 people that do work of 4 and get paid for 3.</p>
<p>Project management tip on delays:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start w/ how many days per page/screen.</li>
<li>Let say answer is 2 weeks to do all &#39;8&#39;.</li>
<li>On due day - I need an extra week.
:-). That is sunk cost.</li>
<li>What do you do as SD manager?</li>
<li>Hint: Mythical Man Month.</li>

<h2 id="how-10x-here-are-the-tenants-of-the-confident-meta-software-development-manager-">How 10X? Here are the tenants of the confident Meta&reg; software development manager:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pug, RIOTjs as 4GL: Declarative. Eschew 3GL.</li>
<li>Extreme serveries as the &#39;next&#39; cloud. Reduced full stack developers. Plus productivity due to focus</li>
<li>Select a CSS FE framework</li>
<li>SPA = reduced Swift/Andorid developers.</li>
<li>Docker Admin / Build server as force multiplier.</li>
<li>Mount (vs FTP). Fast deployment is live deployment. Move fast and break things.</li>
<li>WebIDE + Remove friendly. Team player, poor, broken dev env. Reduce turnover, but plan on it.</li>
<li>Intercept/Observe and UX culture</li>
<li>Meta is a build server, but also how you think about web app development and productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>PHP creator hated to code. Now LAMP, ex: WordPress have 40% share of WWW.</p>
<!-- story -->
<p>Our Goal: Deliver 10 X faster software development.
We leverage curated list of tech and technique. For example one of about 10 of them is: we reposition Pug as 4GL declarative language.</p>
<p>For comparison LAMP, the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so tech gets 10 times better <em>FORCING</em> everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive software development team.</p>
<p>So far, somehow, SSR LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WP having some 30% of WWW - time to start displacing that. But there are staticlly generated CMS approaches trying to get at them.</p>
<p>The extra power of nbake can be used to &#39;tell the story better&#39;, by being more interactive in your UX. Experience shows that better UX translates to more user engaged and higher user retention.</p>
<p>As a starting point, we assume that everyone is web literate, for example:
&#39; Design and Build Websites &#39; by Jon Duckett
We also assume that you will learn Pug.</p>
<p>Meta&reg; Logo- is a monkey using a box to reach something: You should use a build server.
<!-- end story --></p>
<p>One last thing:
Goal: 10 X faster than today&#39;s development.
Did we get there?</p>
<p>Meta software development manager&#39;s Quiz/Crossword w/ answer key:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dev includes (Intercept/Observer) to get insight and alignment.</li>
<li>A team player uses shared docker and (WebIDE)</li>
<li>You should use flat file as static DB via generated JSON and/or client-side-only (FireStore) for auth and dynamic data store - similar to how Mobile Aps Work.</li>
<li>Mobile apps with same code require that you Web app be (SPA) via App Shell.</li>
<li>Developers are measured in number of pages (per day)</li>
<li>Front end code is (disposable) layer, it gets redone from time to time.</li>
<li>As a manager I have a (productivity) goal</li>

<p>I heard you like 3 tier:</p>
<ol>
<li>CDN/FTP/S3 HTTP Host</li>
<li>A host for Docker build server in the cloud</li>
<li>Fire store</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-get-started-">How to get started:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Manager will create the above 3 accounts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manager will facilitate user|feature stories.</p>
</li>
<li>Manager will monitor developer productivity, ex: # of pages per day/week.</li>
<li>Manager will putting people in positions to succeed. For example, a full stack developer does not have sufficient CSS experience = can&#39;t do front end dev.</li>
<li>Web design agency willing to use Pug, FireBase</li>
<li>Meta methodology includes Intercept/Observe. At least show how much you care before you show how much you know.</li>
