<p>Conclusion</p>
<ul>
<li>low code</li>
<li>declarative language</li>
<li>focus on the users, UX</li>
<li>intercept users early</li>
<li>cloud development</li>
<li>Server-less</li>
<li>mounted build - to the production server</li>
<li>static db of content</li>
<li>have a productivity goal</li>
<li>c less second hand user stories.</li>
<li>think of it as disposable &#39;code&#39;, upgrade at least one a year</li>
</ul>
<p>How did we get an accounting system? Tell manager we can fire some book keepers and still have better system.</p>
<p>PHP creator hated to code. Now they have 40% share of WWW.</p>
<p>We used to sell accounting software: By running it, a company could fire some book keepers. The value.</p>
<p>Meta = by using this approach - you can manage costs.
Staff you should reduce/outsource going forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>IOS developers</li>
<li>Android developers</li>
<li>Full stack|back end developers</li>
<li>Photoshop guy/gal
&quot;We decided to go in a different direction, we can use consulting in a transition&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff (you do need):</p>
<ul>
<li>Designer that codes, or a Front end developers that designers</li>
<li>Build/release engineer(can be out sourced)</li>
</ul>
<!-- story -->
<p>Our Goal: Deliver 10 X faster software development. Ex: 5 dev in 6 months to be done 2 devs in 3 weeks.
We leverage curated list of tech and technique. For example one of about 10 of them is: we reposition Pug as 4GL declarative language.</p>
<p>For comparison LAMP, the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so tech gets 10 times better <em>FORCING</em> everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive team.</p>
<p>So far, somehow, SSR LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WP having some 30% of WWW - time to start displacing that.</p>
<p>The extra power of nbake can be used to &#39;tell the story better&#39;, by being more interactive in your UX. Experience shows that better UX translates to more user engaged and higher user retention.</p>
<p>We assume that everyone is web literate, for example:
&#39; Design and Build Websites &#39; by Jon Duckett</p>
<p>We also assume that you will learn Pug.</p>
<!-- end story -->
<p>Question: you are conducting an interview a candidate, they know CSS Frameworks. Please estimate time to write back end and middleware REST API service + User auth(join/password reset, etc) for 6 pages/screens. With  ORM, cache, secured edge distributed servers. Assume 5 api calls per page/screen. Estimate how long that would take you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta developer answer: 0 time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meta software development manager&#39;s Quiz/Crossword w/ answer key:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dev includes (Intercept/Observer) to get insight and alignment.</li>
<li>A team player uses shared docker and (WebIDE)</li>
<li>You should use flat file as static DB via generated JSON and/or client-side-only (FireStore) for auth and dynamic data store - similar to how Mobile Aps Work.</li>
<li>Mobile apps with same code require that you Web app be (SPA) via App Shell.</li>
<li>Developers are measured in number of pages (per day)</li>
<li>Front end code is (disposable) layer, it gets redone from time to time.
Free Meta T-Shirt to first person to finish cross word puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>A software development manager Excel example on head count/staffing/resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server-less + API = ~40% to 60% staffing AND resource cut</li>
<li>4GL Declarative programing = ~ 2X to 10X productivity increase</li>
<li>Build server/build engineer = force multiplier. 2 to 3 FTE savings</li>
<li>Polyglot staff = increased retention, 10% to 20% productivity due to domain knowledge</li>
<li>Intercept/Observer = 2X savings - due to building the right thing sooner.</li>
<li>50% smaller engineering budget = more money to marketing/lead gen</li>
<li>WebIDE = 15% to 25% improved on IDE stability and remote support.</li>
<li>Focus on Front End = being in the zone more, less context switching.</li>
<li>Measure a before vs after, or A/B test</li>
</ul>
<p>How 10X? The Tenants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pug, RIOTjs as 4GL</li>
<li>Mount (vs FTP)</li>
<li>More CDN</li>
<li>FE framework</li>
<li>No back end. Plus productivity due to focus</li>
<li>SPA = no Swift/Andorid</li>
<li>Docker Build</li>
<li>Mount (vs FTP). Fast deployment is live deployment.</li>
<li>WebIDE + Remove friendly. Reduce turnover, but plan on it.</li>
<li>Intercept/Observe</li>
<li>Meta, how you think about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last thing:
Goal: 10 X faster than today&#39;s development. Ex: 5 dev is 6 months will be done 2 devs in 3 weeks.
Did we get there?</p>
<p>Project management tip on delays:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start w/ how many days per page/screen.</li>
<li>Let say answer is 2 weeks to do all &#39;8&#39;.</li>
<li>On due day - I need an extra week.
:-). That is sunk cost.</li>
<li>What do you do as SD manager?</li>
<li>Hint: Mythical Man Month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sin list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid 3 GL / Procedural / Algol =  eschew js</li>
<li>Avoid Full stack developers: They don&#39;t know CSS.</li>
<li>Avoid resume based development</li>
<li>No full stack: Convergence of dev and designer</li>
<li>Rapid prototype / Prototype -&gt; UX. So evaluate need for &#39;PDF&#39; prototypes, like PhotoShop. You should count on your RAD. Instead look at User Stories plus Intercept/Observe.</li>
<li>Developers that love to code can be harmful.</li>
<li>Avoid FTP. Mount (and cache). Reduce Git - you don&#39;t put your DB in git, just back up.</li>
<li>JSX. Takes declarative lang into procedural.</li>
<li>No LAM(+P)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-get-started-">How to get started:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Manager will create FTP/CDN|S3 and a docker host for build server. Developers will from docker mount the FTP/CDN|S3</li>
<li>Manager will facilitate user|feature stories.</li>
<li>Manager will ensure there is a build engineer resource.</li>
<li>Manager will monitor developer productivity, ex: # of pages per day/week.</li>
<li>Manager will putting people in positions to succeed. For example, a full stack developer does not have sufficient CSS experience = can&#39;t do front end dev.</li>
<li>Wed design agency willing to use Pug, FireBase
Low end laptops. Dual core. Vs name with lots of ram in cloud.</li>
<li>Manger controls/owns DB, ex: FireStore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Convert blog to nbake.
Switch to Cloud Development
Intercept/Observe
Have a productivity goal
Switch to Static Server
Change tittles from &#39;RAILS developer&#39; to &#39;Product Developer&#39; or better.
Take Train the Trainer online class
Migrate to Server more API services - bespoke.</p>
