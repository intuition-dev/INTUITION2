## 10 practices of the confident tech manager from META bespoke admin|build|methodology&reg; :

Conclusion
* low code
* declarative language
* focus on the users, UX
* intercept users early
* cloud development
* Server-less
* mounted build - to the production server
* static db of content
* have a productivity goal
* c less second hand user stories.
* think of it as disposable 'code', upgrade at least one a year


PHP creator hated to code. Now they have 40% share of WWW.


We used to sell accounting software: By running it, a company could fire some book keepers. The value.

Meta = by using this approach - you can manage costs.
Staff you should reduce/outsource going forward:
- IOS developers
- Android developers
- Full stack|back end developers
- Photoshop guy/gal
"We decided to go in a different direction, we can use consulting in a transition"

Staff (you do need):
- Designer that codes, or a Front end developers that designers
- Build/release engineer(can be out sourced)


<!-- story -->
Our Goal: Deliver 10 X faster software development. Ex: 5 dev in 6 months to be done 2 devs in 3 weeks.
We leverage curated list of tech and technique. For example one of about 10 of them is: we reposition Pug as 4GL declarative language.

For comparison LAMP, the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so tech gets 10 times better *FORCING* everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive team.

So far, somehow, SSR LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WP having some 30% of WWW - time to start displacing that.

The extra power of nbake can be used to 'tell the story better', by being more interactive in your UX. Experience shows that better UX translates to more user engaged and higher user retention.

We assume that everyone is web literate, for example:
' Design and Build Websites ' by Jon Duckett

We also assume that you will learn Pug.

One last thing:
Goal: 10 X faster than today's development. Ex: 5 dev is 6 months will be done 2 devs in 3 weeks.
Did we get there?




Sin list:
* Avoid 3 GL / Procedural / Algol =  eschew js
* Avoid resume based development
* No full stack: Convergence of dev and designer
* Rapid prototype / Prototype -> UX. So evaluate need for 'PDF' prototypes, like PhotoShop. You should count on your RAD. Instead look at User Stories plus Intercept/Observe.
* Developers that love to code can be harmful.
* Avoid FTP. Mount (and cache). Reduce Git - you don't put your DB in git, just back up.
* JSX. Takes declarative lang into procedural.
