### METAbake&trade; is a development productivity suite. It should allow you to deliver 10 times faster than on a LAMP stack. We have found that - with METAbake&trade; - the work of 5 developers over 3 months can be done by 2 developers in 3 weeks. We expect you to achieve the same productivity gains.



## WebAApp best practices from POV of Manager. How 10X? Here are the tenants of the confident Meta&reg; software development manager:
- Pug, RIOTjs as 4GL: Declarative. Eschew 3GL.
- Extreme serveries as the 'next' cloud. Reduced full stack developers. Plus productivity due to focus
- Select a SASS FE framework
- SPA = reduced Swift/Android developers.
- Docker Admin / Build server as force multiplier.
- Mount (vs FTP). Fast deployment is live deployment. Move fast and break things.
- WebIDE + Remove friendly. Team player, poor, broken dev env. Reduce turnover, but plan on it.
- Intercept/Observe and UX culture
- Meta is a build server, but also how you think about web app development and productivity.

PHP creator hated to code. Now LAMP, ex: WordPress have 40% share of WWW.

<!-- story -->
Our Goal: Deliver 10 X faster software development.
We leverage curated list of tech and technique. For example one of about 10 of them is: we reposition Pug as 4GL declarative language.

For comparison LAMP, the technology WordPress was built on. Every 10 years or so tech gets 10 times better *FORCING* everyone to upgrade. Assembly was 10 times better than machine language. C is 10 times better than Assembly. We believe that we found the answer on how to have a more productive software development team.

So far, somehow, SSR LAMP has dominated web deployments, with WP having some 30% of WWW - time to start displacing that. But there are statically generated CMS approaches trying to get at them.

The extra power of nbake can be used to 'tell the story better', by being more interactive in your UX. Experience shows that better UX translates to more user engaged and higher user retention.

As a starting point, we assume that everyone is web literate, for example:
' Design and Build Websites ' by Jon Duckett
We also assume that you will learn Pug.

Meta&reg; Logo- is a monkey using a box to reach something: You should use a build server.

One last thing:
Goal: 10 X faster than today's development.
Did we get there?


Meta software development manager's Quiz/Crossword w/ answer key:
- Dev includes (Intercept/Observer) to get insight and alignment.
- A team player uses shared docker and (WebIDE)
- You should use flat file as static DB via generated JSON and/or client-side-only (FireStore) for auth and dynamic data store - similar to how Mobile Aps Work.
- Mobile apps with same code require that you Web app be (SPA) via App Shell.
- Developers are measured in number of pages (per day)
- Front end code is (disposable) layer, it gets redone from time to time.
- As a manager I have a (productivity) goal
