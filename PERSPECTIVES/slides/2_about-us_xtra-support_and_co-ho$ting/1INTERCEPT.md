After you have a high velocity development (aka RAD) team that can prototype

# The development process for META is rapid UX prototyping

Starts with Intercept and Observe - Parts of Lean UX research.

One member of your dev team, ex: lead front end developer|designer must physically observe a targeted user. What people say and what they do is not the same.

Step 2 is easy: high velocity development.

It *MUST* be high velocity development to have 'escape velocity'.

Meta counts on high velocity development, and 'Intercept and Observe'.

There are services that can help schedule observation of your target, ex: http://ethn.io/pricing or https://www.userinterviews.com/

At the end of an iteration - there is user testing/ Observe your user with your webapp.
